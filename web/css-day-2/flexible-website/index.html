                        Hummingbirds are birds native to the Americas and constituting the biological
                        family Trochilidae. They are the smallest of birds, most species measuring
                        7.5–13 cm (3–5 in) in length. The smallest extant hummingbird species is the
                        5 cm (2.0 in) bee hummingbird, which weighs less than 2.0 g (0.07 oz).
                        The largest hummingbird species is the 23 cm (9.1 in) giant hummingbird,
                        weighing 18–24g (0.63–0.85 oz).

                        They are known as hummingbirds because of the humming sound created by their
                        beating wings, which flap at high frequencies audible to humans.
                        They hover in mid-air at rapid wing-flapping rates, which vary from around
                        12 beats per second in the largest species, to in excess of 80 in some of
                        the smallest. Of those species that have been measured in wind tunnels,
                        their top speeds exceed 15 m/s (54 km/h; 34 mph) and some species can dive
                        at speeds in excess of 22 m/s (79 km/h; 49 mph).
                        Hummingbirds have the highest mass-specific metabolic rate of any homeothermic animal.
                        To conserve energy when food is scarce, and nightly when not foraging, they can go into torpor,
                        a state similar to hibernation, slowing their metabolic rate to 1/15th of its normal rate.

                        The violetears are hummingbirds of the genus Colibri. They are medium to large species
                        found in Mexico, and Central and northern South America. The Mexican violetear
                        occasionally wanders as far north as the United States and even Canada.
                        Violetears have ample rounded tails and short or medium black bills.
                        Three of the four species have a mainly green plumage.
                        The males have a violet blue patch running back and down from the eye,
                        which is erected when they are excited, and a glittering throat patch.
                        The female plumage is generally like the male's,
                        but the ear and throat patches are smaller.
